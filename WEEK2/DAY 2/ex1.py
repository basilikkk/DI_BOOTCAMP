Create a list called all_cats, which holds three cat instances : one Bengal, one Chartreux and one Siamese.
Those three cats are Saraâ€™s pets. Create a variable called sara_pets which value is an instance of the Pet class, and pass the variable all_cats to the new instance.
Take all the cats for a walk, use the walk method."""
